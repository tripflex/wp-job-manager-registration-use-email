Allow users to login with their email, as well as use email address as username when a new user registers with WP Job Manager. Set custom label for `Username` on entire site. Compatible with Jobify (removes username from register form).

== Description ==

This plugin will use the email address as the username whenever someone registers through WP Job Manager.  This will also work with any other plugins or themes that use the `job_manager_create_account_data` filter.

Change the default label "Username" for all login screens to use a customized user-defined label.

Version 1.3.0 of this plugin includes a new feature for WP Job Manager and Jobify theme that removes the "Username" field from the Registration Form
Version 1.3.1 adds the ability for users to still login with their email address (in case they change their email)

The Jobify theme has been confirmed and tested to work correctly with this plugin.

* note: * using email as username is disabled by default, you must enable it under the WP Job Manager settings page.  There is a link to the page when you activate this plugin.
